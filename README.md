Project 1: -
ECS Project Overview
1. Build and Containerize the Application:


2. Develop a project with PHP And RDS Database
Use Docker to containerize both the React and Node.js applications.
Deploy to ECS:


3. Use Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) for deployment.
Leverage Fargate or EC2 launch types based on project requirements.
Infrastructure Management:


4. Use Terraform to define and provision the infrastructure as code (IaC).
Include ECS Cluster, Task Definitions, Load Balancers, and VPC configurations in the Terraform setup.
CI/CD Pipeline:


5. Use Jenkins for implementing a complete CI/CD pipeline:
Automate building and pushing Docker images to Amazon ECR.
Automate Terraform deployment for ECS infrastructure.
Deploy and update tasks in ECS automatically as part of the pipeline.
Artifact Storage:


6. Use Amazon S3 to store build artifacts such as frontend assets, configuration `files, or backups.
Code Quality:


7. Integrate SonarQube into Jenkins to analyze and maintain code quality.

Pipeline Workflow (High-Level)
Build Stage:


8. Use Jenkins to clone the repository from GitHub or GitLab.
Run linting, testing, and static code analysis using SonarQube.
Dockerization:


9. Build Docker images for PHP applications.
Push Docker images to Amazon ECR.
Terraform Deployment:


10. Jenkins triggers Terraform scripts to provision or update ECS infrastructure.
Ensure the backend state for Terraform is stored securely (e.g., S3 with locking via DynamoDB).
ECS Deployment:


11. Jenkins updates ECS task definitions to point to the latest Docker images.
Use a blue-green or rolling update strategy to ensure zero downtime.
Post-Deployment:


11.Monitor logs and metrics using Amazon CloudWatch.
# A line added for UAT
Validate the deployment and send notifications on completion.
